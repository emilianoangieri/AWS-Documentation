# AWS-Architecture_public_private_subnets

### Intro

The aim of this guide is not replace the AWS documentation but is shown step-by-step of create and combine AWS resources in cloud console.

In this guide I explain step by step how create an infrastructure on AWS Cloud following design best practicies.

The goal is create a two tier infrastructure with a DMZ for public accessible application and protect sensible infrastructure zones with private subnets.

A common usage example could be a LAMP application on which Web Server should be exposed over the internet, instead the database servers should be protected on private subnets.

More details are available on AWS Documentation here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenarios.html.


### Architecture goal

The architecture goal is reported in the image below.

The first image represent an high level diagram of the AWS infrastructure that we are going to create.

The main AWS resources that will be created are:

1. Virtual Private Cloud (better known as VPC).
It is a virtual network on which all the AWS resources (like ELB, EC2, DB,..) are created (more details available on AWS documentation here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html).
2. Security Group.
The security group acts as a virtual firewall that allow the control inbound and outbound traffic (more details available on AWS documentation here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html).
